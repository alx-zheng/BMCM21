# Brown Mathematical Modeling Contest Fall 2021

This repository contains the submission from Roy Kim, Benjamin Shih, and I(Alex Zheng). Here lives the paper and code for the BMCM 2021, during which we responded to a problem regarding the best combination of hazard reduction burning (HRB) and logging strategies to mitigate Australian forest fires. Our submission won the [Brown competition](https://www.dam.brown.edu/siam/bmcm.html) and a university sponsorship to the [international contest (IMCM)](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/).

Please consult our written paper and jupyter notebook to learn more about our model and result.
